This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to loose comparisons. The `bug.php` file contains a function that incorrectly identifies the string '0' as numerically equivalent to the integer 0 due to PHP's loose comparison (`==`) operator.  The `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected code using strict comparison (`===`).  This highlights the importance of using strict comparison when type safety is crucial.
