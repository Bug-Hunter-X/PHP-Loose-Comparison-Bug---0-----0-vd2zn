This code suffers from a subtle bug related to how PHP handles type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  The comparison `'0' == 0` evaluates to `true` in PHP because of loose comparison.  However,  `'0' === 0` evaluates to `false` as it's a strict comparison, checking both type and value.

```php
<?php
function checkValue($value) {
  if ($value == 0) {
    return 'Value is zero';
  } else {
    return 'Value is not zero';
  }
}

$test1 = 0;
$test2 = '0';
echo checkValue($test1); // Output: Value is zero
echo checkValue($test2); // Output: Value is zero, despite being a string!
?>
```
